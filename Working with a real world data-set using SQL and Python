Working with a real world data-set using SQL and Python
Estaimted time needed: 30 minutes

Objectives
After complting this lab you will be able to:

Understand the dataset for Chicago Public School level performance
Store the dataset in an Db2 database on IBM Cloud instance
Retrieve metadata about tables and columns and query data from mixed case columns
Solve example problems to practice your SQL skills including using built-in database functions
Chicago Public Schools - Progress Report Cards (2011-2012)
The city of Chicago released a dataset showing all school level performance data used to create School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. The dataset is available from the Chicago Data Portal: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t

This dataset includes a large number of metrics. Start by familiarizing yourself with the types of metrics in the database: https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/assets/AAD41A13-BE8A-4E67-B1F5-86E711E09D5F?download=true

NOTE:

Do not download the dataset directly from City of Chicago portal. Instead download a static copy which is a more database friendly version from this link.

Now review some of its contents.

Store the dataset in a Table
In many cases the dataset to be analyzed is available as a .CSV (comma separated values) file, perhaps on the internet. To analyze the data using SQL, it first needs to be stored in the database.

While it is easier to read the dataset into a Pandas dataframe and then PERSIST it into the database as we saw in the previous lab, it results in mapping to default datatypes which may not be optimal for SQL querying. For example a long textual field may map to a CLOB instead of a VARCHAR.

Therefore, it is highly recommended to manually load the table using the database console LOAD tool, as indicated in Week 2 Lab 1 Part II. The only difference with that lab is that in Step 5 of the instructions you will need to click on create "(+) New Table" and specify the name of the table you want to create and then click "Next".

Now open the Db2 console, open the LOAD tool, Select / Drag the .CSV file for the CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS dataset and load the dataset into a new table called SCHOOLS.

Connect to the database
Let us now load the ipython-sql extension and establish a connection with the database

The following modules are pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment. However if you run this notebook commands in a different Jupyter environment (e.g. Watson Studio or Ananconda) you may need to install these libraries by removing the # sign before !pip in the code cell below.

# These libraries are pre-installed in SN Labs. If running in another environment please uncomment lines below to install them:
# !pip install --force-reinstall ibm_db==3.1.0 ibm_db_sa==0.3.3
# Ensure we don't load_ext with sqlalchemy>=1.4 (incompadible)
# !pip uninstall sqlalchemy==1.4 -y && pip install sqlalchemy==1.3.24
# !pip install ipython-sql
%load_ext sql
# Enter the connection string for your Db2 on Cloud database instance below
# %sql ibm_db_sa://my-username:my-password@my-hostname:my-port/my-db-name?security=SSL
%sql ibm_db_sa://vwv79926:vvdsmcd07kU2B01v@ea286ace-86c7-4d5b-8580-3fbfa46b1c66.bs2io90l08kqb1od8lcg.databases.appdomain.cloud:31505/bludb?security=SSL
'Connected: vwv79926@bludb'
Query the database system catalog to retrieve table metadata
You can verify that the table creation was successful by retrieving the list of all tables in your schema and checking whether the SCHOOLS table was created
# type in your query to retrieve list of all tables in the database for your db2 schema (username)
​
%sql select * from SYSCAT.TABLES where TABNAME = 'SCHOOLS'

or, a better way:
​

Summary
In this lab you learned how to work with a real word dataset using SQL and Python. You learned how to query columns with spaces or special characters in their names and with mixed case names. You also used built in database functions and practiced how to sort, limit, and order result sets, as well as used sub-queries and worked with multiple tables.
